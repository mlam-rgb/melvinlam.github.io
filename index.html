    <h2>Short Bio</h2>

      and how artists build sustainable careers.

    <h2>Extra Section: What I’m Working On</h2>
    <p>
      I’m exploring ways to help artists grow and move forward when they feel stuck,
      especially around direction, visibility, and structure.

    <h2 id="toggleHeading">What I Care About Right Now</h2>

    <p id="purposeText" style="display: none; margin-top: 12px;">
      Right now I’m focused on learning new tools and concepts that help me better understand how to create real
      solutions for artists who are growing musically but feel stuck when it comes to direction, visibility, or structure.
      I’m curious about why some artists with real talent find momentum while others struggle to move forward, even when
      the potential is clearly there. I’m especially interested in frameworks and ways of thinking that align with how I
      already approach problems and allow me to go deeper instead of reacting on instinct. This matters to me because I
      want to develop ideas that support artists in that unclear middle stage between growth and sustainability. If someone
      follows what I’m working on, they’ll see a process of learning, testing, and refining ideas into more thoughtful and
      practical solutions.
